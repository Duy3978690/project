 Welcome to our group repository. 

 This is our main working space in this project. The repository included our resources for the project and the final product

 RMATES project: Notes within students

Topic:
  Overall, anyone interested in the topic of Information Technology can find a wealth of information on our website. 
It includes a wide range of articles, tutorials, and interactive content, all of which are intended to teach people more 
about our IT world and its numerous applications. Regarding targeted users, our library of papers, which covers a wide range 
of IT-related topics, is one of the key aspects of our website. This information is gathered by us students and is intended 
for undergraduate students who are having trouble understanding lectures and assignments. As a result, our content provides
step-by-step instructions for understanding particular computer science ideas and programming languages.

Motivation:
  The main driving force behind finishing this project is to assist IT students who are having academic difficulties so 
they can improve their academic performance at school. Because it prevents students from having a difficult or pointless 
time in college or university, we think this project is considerably crucial to pupils around the world.

  In several ways, this project follows current IT trends. It makes use of, for instance, pertinent technologies or techniques 
that are widely used in the field and are highly sought after by employers, such as knowledge of HTML, CSS, and other
collecting and research techniques. We will get the chance to learn more about these IT specialties and to hone skills that 
are in high demand on the job market by working on this project. If we could complete this project, it would demonstrate to 
potential employers that we possess the necessary knowledge and capabilities. It would also prove our capacity for teamwork 
and the ability to finish a challenging assignment from beginning to end.

Landscape:
  There are numerous websites that offer knowledge about IT-related subjects. CNET, TechCrunch, and ZDNet are a few examples. 
These websites offer evaluations and analysis of various tech services and products, as well as news and updates on the most
recent technological advancements and fashions. Our concept would put a strong academic and student-friendly emphasis on all 
facets of IT. As an alternative, our initiative distinguishes itself by providing a distinct viewpoint because it was 
developed by undergraduate students who can relate to the issues that students frequently encounter. We believe that our
product stands out from the competition because it provides students with information that is clearly arranged and easy 
to understand.

How to access:
  Since we do not set up an operating server yet, the only way to access our website is to dowload the source code via our
GitHub or to clone the workspace using an IDE on your computer. 

How to use:
  The webstie is really easy to use: just choose your desirable topic using the navigation bars and it will takes you to
exactly where you wanted.

How to contribute: 
  The website is open public for everyone. For any contribution or collaboration, just create a fork from our master 
branch. You can commit your changes within that fork, and send a pull request to our group's admin. Any pull request or 
changes suggesstion are welcomed with our verification before getting confirmed and merged to the main branch.
