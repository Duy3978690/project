            <h1>Communication In Computer Network</h1>
            <h2>Protocols</h2>
                <p>
                  Protocols are essential for successful transmission of data over a network. Each protocol defines a set of rules that must be agreed between sender and receiver. At the simplest level, a protocol could define that a positive voltage represents a bit with value 1. At the other extreme, a protocol could define the format of the first 40 bytes in a packet. The complexity of networking requires a very large number of protocols, a protocol suite is a collection of related protocols. TCP/IP is the dominant protocol suite for internet usage.
                </p>
              <ul>
                  <li>
                      <strong>Protocol:</strong>
                      A set of rules governing communication between computers.
                  </li>
                  <li>Ensures the computers that communicate understand each other.</li>
              </ul>
            <h2 id="IP">Internet Protocol (IP)</h2>
                <p>
                  The Internet Protocol (IP) is a network layer protocol that is responsible for delivering packets of data from a source to a destination over a network. It does this by routing the packets through intermediate devices such as routers, which use IP addresses to determine the best path for the packets to take.
                  An IP address is a numerical label assigned to each device connected to a computer network that uses the Internet Protocol for communication. It serves two main functions: host or network interface identification and location addressing. IP addresses are written and displayed in human-readable notation, such as 192.168.1.1.
                  There are two versions of IP in use today: IP version 4 (IPv4) and IP version 6 (IPv6). IPv4 is the most widely used version, but it is running out of available addresses due to the rapid growth of the internet. IPv6 was developed to address this issue and is now beginning to be adopted on a larger scale. It uses a 128-bit address space, which allows for significantly more addresses than IPv4's 32-bit address space.
                  In addition to routing packets, IP also provides a number of other services, including fragmentation and reassembly of packets, time-to-live (TTL) value to prevent infinite routing loops, and error checking using a checksum.</p>
                  <h2 id="TCP">Transmission Control Protocol (TCP)</h2>
                  <p>Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a transport layer protocol that is responsible for establishing and maintaining a reliable connection between two devices and ensuring that data is delivered in the correct order. It does this by establishing a connection, breaking the data into segments, and sending each segment with a sequence number to the destination. The destination device then acknowledges receipt of each segment and sends the next segment in the sequence. If a segment is not acknowledged, TCP will retransmit it until it is received. This process ensures that data is delivered accurately and efficiently.
                  TCP is often used in combination with IP, forming the Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol (TCP/IP) suite of protocols. TCP/IP is the basis for communication on the internet and is used by almost all devices connected to the internet, including computers, smartphones, and tablets.
              </p>

            <h2 id="MAC-address">MAC Address</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>A media access control address (MAC address)</strong> is a unique identifier assigned to every device connected
              on a network. This use is common in Ethernet, Wi-Fi, and Bluetooth. MAC addresses are recognizable as
              six groups of two hexadecimal digit which is often displayed with a colon or hyphen, such as
              3F:59:11:22:M9:E3 or 3f-59-11-22-m9-e3.
            </p><br>

            <strong class="duy">Difference between MAC address and IP address:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Both MAC addresses and IP addresses are used to identify your device, but for different reasons:</li>
              <li>MAC addresses are unique to each device while IP addresses can be reassigned or transferred to
                different device.</li>
              <li>When a device with MAC address X may have an IP of 1.2.3.4. If the X device is removed from the
                network, that IP address will be transferred to another device with MAC address Y</li>
              <li>MAC addresses are used to transfer data within the same local network. You need an IP address if you
                want your data to transfer to other networks, such as the Internet.</li>
            </ul>

            <h2 id="Circuit-and-packet-switching">Circuit And Packet Switching</h2>
            <p>
              <strong>Circuit switching</strong> is a method of data transfer in which the message is sent over a dedicated 
              communication channel. The channel is in the physical form. An example of this is a Landline Phone.
            </p><br>

            <strong class="duy">Advantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>The quality of communication is better.</li>
              <li>While switching, no time is wasted in waiting.</li>
              <li>It is preferred when communication is long and continuous.</li>
            </ul>

            <strong class="duy">Disadvantages:</strong>
            <ul>
              <li>Expensive because it used a dedicated channel establishment.</li>
              <li>The time taken for the establishment of the physical path is too long.</li>
              <li>It is preferred when communication is long and continuous.</li>
            </ul>

            <p><strong>Packet switching</strong>is a method of data transfer in which the intended message is broken down into parts 
              and is sent over multiple routes in order to reach its destination and this is known as a packet. When the 
              packet arrives at the destination, it is job of the destination to put these packets in the right order.</p><br>

              <strong class="duy">Advantages:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>No delay in the delivery of the packets.</li>
                <li>No requirement for massive storage space.</li>
                <li>Multiple users can use the same channel while transferring their packets.</li>
              </ul>
  
              <strong class="duy">Disadvantages:</strong>
              <ul>
                <li>Installation costs of packet switching are expensive.</li>
                <li>High-quality voice calls cannot use packet switching as there is a lot of delay.</li>
                <li>Connectivity issues may lead to loss of information and delay in the delivery of the information.</li>
              </ul>
